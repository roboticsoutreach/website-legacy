# Southampton Robotics Outreach


Southampton Robotics Outreach is a society at the University of Southampton who are enthusiastic about getting young people involved in Robotics, Computing, Electronics and STEM. 

We run weekly talks and workshops for our members to prepare them to run events with a range of young people. A number of our members engage in developing new robotics hardware and software that enables us to run events.

Our flagship event is the Computing, Electronics and Robotics summer school that we run annually with the University of Southampton and the Smallpeice Trust.

We also work closely with Student Robotics, a charity that runs an annual robotics competition for 16 - 18 year olds.
