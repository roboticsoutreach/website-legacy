# Are you a teacher or youth leader?

## We can run exciting free robotics activities for your young people!

We aim to inspire young people to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. Our exciting activities are suitable for young people from the age of 6 - 18!

We're based at the University of Southampton, but are happy to work out travel arrangements to inspire learning all across Hampshire!
