# SourceBots Summer School

We run an exciting summer school for 16 and 17 year olds in collaboration with the University of Southampton and The Smallpeice Trust. Southampton Robotics Organisation has been doing this since 2016.

In 2021 we have held a virtual competition where contestants had the oppurtunity to write code for vitual and physical robots.
